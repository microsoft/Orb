# Orb Architecture

![](../documentation/orb_architecture.png)

## Electron
Orb is built on the same open-source platform that powers VSCode, Slack, Microsoft Teams and many others.
Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
You can learn more about it here:

## Built on Open-Source

Orb uses React JS and MobX for rendering and state management along with several other open-source node.JS modules.

## Electron Edge

This open-source module allows running .NET side-by-side with node.JS. This allows us to run PowerShell inside Orb. i.e. run PowerShell, render in Javascript.
